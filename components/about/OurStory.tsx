              Risk Management, which is very much in practice in Western
              countries, was seriously felt in the Indian Insurance Market during
              early 2000. When the Government of India announced privatization in
              the Insurance Industry, it formed the Insurance Regulatory and
              Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to address negligible
              insurance penetration among the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              Insurance products are intangible and legalistic. Insurance
              Companies were eager to accept policies without proper Risk
              Assessment — leading to inordinate claim delays and refusals on
              technical grounds. This is precisely the gap TransIndia was built
              to bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              IRDAI introduced the concept of Broking in 2002, as practiced in
              Western countries.{" "}
              <strong>Transindia Insurance Brokers (India) Pvt. Ltd.</strong>,
              incorporated in July 2006, has since been a licensed insurance
              intermediary — fully concerned about the risks and wellbeing of
              all patrons, associates, and well-wishers.
